The 'imgtest' test case is a complex end-to-end test.
Don't expect it to run out of box, you have to know what you are doing in order to run it.
Sorry.

First you have to set up the host network. The provided 'hostnet' script could help as a recipe.
The 'imgtest' script contains the bulk of the test.
ZORPROOT in the example points to a directory structure which contains the full zorp userspace up from libc.

DO NOT SET IT TO / !!! There is a rm -rf in the script which would go wild, and anyway, your whole filesystem would be much larger than the 2G given to kvm.

Also the zorp binary is expected to be at $ZORPROOT/lib/zorp/zorp, not in /usr/lib as you would expect.
The imgtest script and things called by it calls sudo in several places. In some instances stdout/stderr is redirected, so you might not even notice the prompt.
You better do a 'sudo ls' before running the testcase if your sudo is configured with sane timeouts.
