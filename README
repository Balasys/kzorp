Kzorp is a open source set of mechanisms to implement mixed packet filter/application level gateway functionality on Linux.
Kzorp is used by Zorp, and anyone is welcome to use it with other gateways.

You can install it by the autoreconf -i;./configure;make;make install combo.
There will be Debian packages soon, promise.

See the file COPYRIGHT for copyright (which is GPL), and HACKING.md on internals and stuff.

This repository contains all you need to have a functioning kzorp:
 - the kernel module
 - the iptables userspace - to manipulate iptables rules
 - the python userspace - to manipulate zones, services, etc
